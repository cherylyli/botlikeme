Creating an AI bot trained from my facebook messages

1. Ask facebook for all my records, this includes all my messages. Facebook would email me a link to download this info after a few days.

2. Created a python file that extracts the messages.htm into just the messages, without all the tags. This condensed the 20MB file I had into a 3.8MB file(not included due to privacy reasons). This took a couple minutes.
